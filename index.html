	<p>A dragon is a large, serpentine legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures around the world. Beliefs about dragons 
		vary considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, 
		four-legged, and capable of breathing fire. Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures 
		with above-average intelligence.
